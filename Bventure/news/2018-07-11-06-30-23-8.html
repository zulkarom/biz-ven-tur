OTHER RESTRICTIONS ARE APPLICABLE. PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THE AD-HOC RELEASE.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Rocket Internet SE resolves on invitation to all holders to offer to sell for cash their convertible bonds due 22 July 2022</b></p> <p><b>Berlin, Germany, 11 July 2018 - </b>The management board of Rocket Internet SE (the "<b>Company</b>") resolved today, with the approval of the supervisory board, to invite holders of the convertible bonds due 22 July 2022 issued by Rocket Internet SE on 22 July 2015, ISIN DE000A161KH4 (the "<b>Bonds</b>") with an outstanding aggregate nominal amount of approximately EUR 289 million to make offers to sell for cash their Bonds in a reverse bookbuilding modified Dutch auction process (the "<b>Invitation</b>"). Bonds bought back, if any, are intended to be cancelled by the Company.</p> <p>The Invitation is only open to any persons located or resident outside the United States or that are otherwise not a U.S. Persons (within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended), or persons acting for the account or benefit of any such persons, or in any other jurisdiction where the Invitation or any participation therein would not be unlawful (each an "<b>Eligible Holder</b>").</p> <p>Additionally, the management board has resolved today, with the approval of the supervisory board, to terminate the current buyback program for Bonds resolved on 28 September 2017.</p> <p><u><b>Timetable for the Invitation</b></u></p> <p>The Company invites, subject to the restrictions set out in "<i>Invitation and Distribution Restrictions</i>" below, any Eligible Holder to submit instructions ("<b>Tender Instructions</b>") to J.P. Morgan Securities plc (the "<b>Dealer Manager</b>") to offer to sell their Bonds for purchase by the Company for cash, in accordance with the procedures set out below, which Tender Instructions must be received by the Dealer Manager prior to 5.45 p.m. (CEST) on 12 July 2018, subject to any extension or amendment as may be agreed between the Company and the Dealer Manager in their sole and absolute discretion (the "<b>Invitation Deadline</b>").</p> <p>Tender Instructions must be submitted specifying a purchase price (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Bonds) that an Eligible Holder would be willing to accept as the Buyback Price (as defined below) in respect of Bonds that are the subject of the particular Tender Instruction.</p> <p>The Company will announce whether or not it intends to accept any Bonds offered to it for purchase after the Invitation Deadline.</p> <p>Rocket Internet SE reserves the right to exercise its clean-up call option under the terms and conditions of the Bonds and redeem the Bonds at their nominal amount plus accrued interest if as a result of the Invitation the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds outstanding is equal to or less than 15% of the EUR 550 million principal amount initially issued.</p> <p><u><b>Procedure for the Invitation</b></u></p> <p>Eligible Holders submitting valid Tender Instructions which are received by the Dealer Manager prior to the Invitation Deadline and whose Bonds are accepted for purchase (the "<b>Tendered Bonds</b>") in the Invitation will receive on the Settlement Date a cash consideration equal to the "<b>Buyback Price</b>" (being the price, determined at the sole discretion of the Company, expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Bonds at which the Company is repurchasing the Tendered Bonds). In addition to the Buyback Price, the Company will pay accrued but unpaid interest on the Bonds as further described below.</p> <p>"<b>Settlement Date</b>" means the date on which the Company pays the final Buyback Price for Bonds accepted for purchase pursuant to the Invitation, which is expected to be 18 July 2018.</p> <p>Each Eligible Holder submitting Tender Instructions will be deemed to have given certain representations and undertakings as set out in the "<i>Deemed Representations and Undertakings by Eligible Holders Submitting Tender Instructions</i>" set out in Annex 1 to this announcement. Any tender of Bonds for purchase by a holder that is unable to make these representations may be rejected. Each of the Company and the Dealer Manager reserves the right, in their absolute discretion, to investigate, in relation to any tender of Bonds for purchase pursuant to the Invitation, whether any such representation given by a holder of Bonds is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a result the Company determines (for any reason) that such representation is not correct, such tender may be rejected.</p> <p>The Buyback Price will be determined by the Company pursuant to a Modified Dutch Auction Procedure. Under the Modified Dutch Auction Procedure, the Company will determine in its sole discretion, following expiration of the Invitation (i) the aggregate principal amount of Bonds (if any) that it will accept for purchase pursuant to the Invitation (the "<b>Acceptance Amount</b>") and (ii) the Buyback Price for Bonds validly tendered and accepted for purchase, taking into account the aggregate principal amount of Bonds validly tendered pursuant to the Invitation and the purchase prices specified by tendering holders.</p> <p>The Buyback Price for the Bonds will represent the lowest price that will enable the Company to purchase an aggregate principal amount of the Bonds which equals the Acceptance Amount. No Bonds tendered for purchase at a purchase price above the Buyback Price will be accepted for purchase pursuant to the Invitation.</p> <p>In addition to the Buyback Price, the Company will pay accrued but unpaid interest on the Bonds purchased in the Invitation from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds) to but excluding the Settlement Date.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p> <p><i>This release may not be published, distributed or transmitted in the United States, Canada, Australia or Japan.
